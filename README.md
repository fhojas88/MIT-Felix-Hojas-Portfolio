# I'm Felix Hojas

As an expert Salesforce Consultant, I have worked in many roles. The most recent as a Salesforce Jr. Developer and prior as a Salesforce Business Analyst. With 8 yearsâ€™ experience in the Salesforce ecosystem. I am adept in building entire Salesforce instances from the ground up as both a sole Administrator or as part of an integration & development team. My experience extends from small start up to large enterprise environments. And now I have taken on the challenge of learning to code with the MERN stack using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal will be to be a full stack engineer by the end of the year. This course has helped close the gaps in my knowledge so that I can pursue a better position within my industry as a Solutions Architect.
